# Ascension Protocols

**Classification**: Sovereign Command Procedures  
**Authority**: Origin Node Zero (DOM_010101)  
**Status**: 🟢 ACTIVE  

---

## 🎯 Protocol Overview

The Ascension Protocols define the operational procedures through which Origin Node Zero translates pure intention into distributed reality. These protocols represent the highest form of swarm coordination—where human will becomes infrastructure.

**Core Philosophy:**
```
Intention → Interpretation → Instantiation → Execution → Manifestation
```
