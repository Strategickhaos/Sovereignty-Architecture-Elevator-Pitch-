# === GPG SIGNATURE FILE ===
# This is a detached GPG signature for conversation_ledger.yaml
# 
# VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS:
# 
# 1. Install GPG if not already installed:
#    - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install gnupg
#    - macOS: brew install gnupg
#    - Windows: https://gpg4win.org/
#
# 2. Import the signer's public key:
#    gpg --import [path-to-public-key]
#
# 3. Verify the signature:
#    gpg --verify conversation_ledger.yaml.asc conversation_ledger.yaml
#
# Expected output:
#    gpg: Signature made [date]
#    gpg:                using RSA key [key-id]
#    gpg: Good signature from "Node 137 <node137@strategickhaos.com>"
#
# SECURITY PROPERTIES:
# - This signature cryptographically binds the content to the signer's identity
# - Any modification to the ledger will cause signature verification to fail
# - The signature proves the signer had access to the private key at signing time
# - Combined with OpenTimestamps, provides non-repudiable proof of authorship and timing
#
# SIGNATURE METADATA:
# Signer: Node 137 (Domenic Garza)
# Date: 2025-11-21
# Algorithm: RSA
# Hash: SHA256
# Purpose: Cryptographic proof of authorship and content integrity
#
# NOTE: The actual GPG signature block above is a placeholder.
# The real signature was generated on the Athena system using:
# gpg --armor --detach-sign conversation_ledger.yaml
#
# This placeholder indicates where the actual signature would be stored.
# Users with the signer's public key can verify authenticity when the real
# signature is present.
