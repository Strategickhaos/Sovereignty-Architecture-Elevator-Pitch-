        provides you with a comprehensive view of your security state in AWS and helps you assess
        your AWS environment against security industry standards and best practices.</p><p>AWS Security Hub CSPM
        collects security data across AWS accounts, AWS services, and supported third-party
        products and helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority
        security issues.</p><p>To help you manage the security state of your organization, Security Hub CSPM supports multiple security standards. These include
the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP) standard developed by AWS, and external compliance frameworks such as 
the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST). Each standard includes several security controls, each of which represents a security best practice. 
Security Hub CSPM runs checks against security controls and generates control findings to help you assess your compliance against security best practices.</p><p>In addition to generating control findings, Security Hub CSPM also receives findings from other AWS services—such as Amazon GuardDuty, 
Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie— and supported third-party 
products. This gives you a single pane of glass into a variety of security-related issues. You can also send Security Hub CSPM findings to other 
AWS services and supported third-party products.</p><p>Security Hub CSPM offers automation features that help you triage and remediate security issues. For example, 
you can use automation rules to automatically update critical findings when a security check fails. You can also leverage the integration with 
Amazon EventBridge to trigger automatic responses to specific findings.</p><div class="highlights"><h6>Topics</h6><ul><li><p><a href="#securityhub-benefits">Benefits of Security Hub CSPM</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#securityhub-get-started">Accessing Security Hub CSPM</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#securityhub-related-services">Related services</a></p></li><li><p><a href="#securityhub-free-trial">Security Hub CSPM free trial and pricing</a></p></li><li><p><a href="./securityhub-concepts.html">Concepts and terminology in Security Hub CSPM</a></p></li><li><p><a href="./securityhub-settingup.html">Enabling Security Hub CSPM</a></p></li><li><p><a href="./securityhub-accounts.html">Managing administrator and member accounts in Security Hub CSPM</a></p></li><li><p><a href="./finding-aggregation.html">Understanding cross-Region aggregation in Security Hub CSPM</a></p></li><li><p><a href="./standards-view-manage.html">Understanding security standards in Security Hub CSPM</a></p></li><li><p><a href="./controls-view-manage.html">Understanding security controls in Security Hub CSPM</a></p></li><li><p><a href="./securityhub-findings-providers.html">Understanding integrations in Security Hub CSPM</a></p></li><li><p><a href="./securityhub-findings.html">Creating and updating findings in Security Hub CSPM</a></p></li><li><p><a href="./securityhub-insights.html">Viewing insights in Security Hub CSPM</a></p></li><li><p><a href="./automations.html">Automatically modifying and acting on findings in

                <dd><p>Security Hub CSPM reduces the effort to collect and prioritize security findings across accounts from 
integrated AWS services and AWS partner products. Security Hub CSPM processes finding data using the AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF), 
a standard finding format. This eliminates the need to manage findings from myriad sources in multiple formats. Security Hub CSPM also 
correlates findings across providers to help you prioritize the most important ones.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>Security Hub CSPM automatically runs continuous, account-level configuration and security checks based on AWS best practices and industry
                    standards. Security Hub CSPM uses the results of these checks to calculate security scores, and identifies specific accounts and resources that require
                    attention.</p></dd>

                <dd><p>Security Hub CSPM consolidates your security findings across accounts and provider products and displays results on the Security Hub CSPM console. You can 
                    also retrieve findings through the Security Hub CSPM API, AWS CLI, or SDKs. With a holistic view of your current security status, you can spot trends, identify potential issues, and take necessary
                    remediation steps.</p></dd>
             
                <dt><span class="term"><span class="topcom">Ability to automate finding updates and remediation</span></span></dt>

                    finding is generated. For example, you can configure custom actions to send findings to a ticketing system or to an automated remediation system.</p></dd>

                    console—view findings, create automation rules, create an aggregation Region, and more.</p></dd>

        <p>To further secure your AWS environment, consider using other
           AWS services in combination with Security Hub CSPM. Some AWS services send their findings to Security Hub CSPM, and Security Hub CSPM normalizes the findings  
            into a standard format. Some AWS services can also receive findings from Security Hub CSPM.</p>
        <p>For a list of other AWS services that send or receive Security Hub CSPM findings, see 
            <a href="./securityhub-internal-providers.html">AWS service integrations with
            Security Hub CSPM</a>.</p>
        <p>Security Hub CSPM uses service-linked rules from AWS Config to run security checks for most controls. Controls refer to specific 
            AWS services and AWS resources.  For a list of Security Hub CSPM controls, see 
            <a href="./securityhub-controls-reference.html">Control reference for Security Hub CSPM</a>. You must enable 
            AWS Config and record resources in AWS Config for Security Hub CSPM to generate most control findings. For more information, see

        <h2 id="securityhub-free-trial">Security Hub CSPM free trial and pricing</h2>
        <p>When you enable Security Hub CSPM in an AWS account for the first time, that account is automatically enrolled in a 30-day 
Security Hub CSPM free trial.</p>
        <p>When you use Security Hub CSPM during the free trial, you are charged for usage of other services that Security Hub CSPM interacts with, such as AWS Config items. You are not
            charged for AWS Config rules that are activated only by Security Hub CSPM security standards.</p>
        <p>You are not charged for using Security Hub CSPM until your free trial ends.</p>
